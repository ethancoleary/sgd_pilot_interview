Congratulations on earning your spot in stage 2. This stage consists of two rounds.
In the first round you will perform the grid task again whereas in the second round, you will delegate the work.
Like in the first stage, you will earn a final payoff from one of these rounds chosen at random. <br><br>

Because of your excellent achievement in stage 1, you are now responsible for a team of workers.
You are the <b>manager</b> of this team and this constitutes a higher payment schedule, responsibility for some of your workers' earnings, and the ability to earn commission off of your workers. <br><br>

Your team is seen below:
