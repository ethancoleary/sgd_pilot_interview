<p>
    You are free to decide how you wish to interview for the managerial position.
    As previously mentioned, the interviewer rewards performance but also luck may be involved.
    </p>
<br>
<p>
    Concretely, you have can choose one of the following interview methods:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You may compete for the managerial position.
      Here you are matched with a randomly selected worker who is currently employed at DataProcess Ltd.
      The worker has previously performed a cognitive task for 90 seconds. You are given 90 seconds to perform the same task.
      If you outperform the worker then you will be successful in the interview and become a manager for the rest of the experiment which leads to opportunities to earn more money.
      In doing so you receive a signing bonus of $2.00.
      If you do not outperform your competitor then you earn neither the manager position nor the signing bonus and leave the experiment.</li>
  <li>You may try your chance with luck. Here you do not compete for the position.
      Instead you will perform a cognitive task for 90 seconds earning $0.10 for each correct answer submitted.
      Following the 90 seconds you enter a draw where you have a 40% chance of being given the manager position and a 60% chance of leaving the experiment.
  However, in this case, you do not earn a signing bonus. </li>
</ol>

Before you make the decision you are free to try out the task which is described in the next page.
