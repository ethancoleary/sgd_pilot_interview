    Stage 1: Round 2

{{ block content }}

<p>In the previous stage, you got to perform the real-effort task and were paid according to your raw performance.
    In this round, you will get to decide how you would like to paid for the task before performing.  </p>
<br>
<p>
    You have been matched with a randomly chosen participant and you will now decide to what extent you wish to compete with this participant.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    You are endowed with 10 tokens and asked to choose the number of tokens that you wish to invest in a tournament (option A).
    The remainder of the 10 tokens will be invested in a
piece-rate compensation scheme, just like the previous stage (option B). Tokens are indivisible.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The payments for each token invested in the options are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> <b>Option A:</b> Tournament pays $0.03 per token invested for each correct grid count <b>if you have a greater score than a randomly chosen participant.</b>
      If you have a lower score than the randomly chosen participant, then you will be paid zero for this token invested.
      In case the two of you tie, you will receive $0.02 coin per token for each correct grid. </li>
    <li> <b>Option B:</b> The piece-rate option pays $0.01 coin per token for each correct grid. </li>
</ol> <br>
<br>

How many of your token would you like to invest into the tournament (option A)? <br>
Text will appear below when you enter a number to help you decide. <br>
