 The first round lasts for 90 seconds.
    During this round you will be tasked with counting the number of ones (1) in a table.
    Once you have counted the number of ones, input the number in the box and click 'next'.
    Your task is to correctly count ones in as many tables as possible in 90 seconds.
    For each table that you correctly complete, you will earn 2 coins (2 coins = $0.05) as bonus. <br>
