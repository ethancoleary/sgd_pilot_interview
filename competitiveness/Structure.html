{{ block content }}

<p>In the previous stage, you got to perform the real-effort task and were paid according to your raw performance.
    In this round, you will get to decide how you would like to paid for the task before performing.  </p>
<br>
<p>
    You have been matched with a randomly chosen participant and you will now decide to what extent you wish to compete with this participant.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    You are endowed with 10 tokens and asked to choose the number of tokens that you wish to invest in a tournament (option A).
    The remainder of the 10 tokens will be invested in a
piece-rate compensation scheme, just like the previous stage (option B). Tokens are indivisible.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The payments for each token invested in the options are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> <b>Option A:</b> Tournament pays $0.03 per token invested for each correct grid count <b>if you have a greater score than a randomly chosen participant.</b>
      If you have a lower score than the randomly chosen participant, then you will be paid zero for this token invested.
      In case the two of you tie, you will receive $0.02 coin per token for each correct grid. </li>
    <li> <b>Option B:</b> The piece-rate option pays $0.01 coin per token for each correct grid. </li>
</ol> <br>
<br>
<p>
    Therefore, if you invest none of your 10 tokens, you will always receive $0.10 per correct grid - the same as in the previous round. <br>
    If you invest all of your 10 tokens into the option A, you will receive $0.30 per correct grid <b>if</b> your performance exceeds that of your opponent, and $0.00 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Below is a set of questions that you must answer correctly to proceed to check your comprehension of the task.</p>
<br>
<b>1. In the previous round, how much money did you receive for each grid correctly counted?</b>
<p>{{ form.comprehension1 }}</p>
<br><br>
<b>2. In the previous round, how did your payment depend on your relative performance compared to other participants?</b>
<p>{{ form.comprehension2 }}</p>
<br><br>
<b>3. In this round, how much money will you receive for each grid correctly counted?</b>
<p>{{ form.comprehension3 }}</p>
<br><br>
<b>4. In this round, how does the amount of tokens you invest affect your payment per correct answer?</b>
<p>{{ form.comprehension4}}</p>
