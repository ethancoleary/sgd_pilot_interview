 Please choose Option A or Option B in each of the following ten lotteries below (select your preferred option in each row).
</p>
<br>
<p>
After you have made all 10 choices, one of the choices will be chosen at random and you will be paid according to this lottery.
    </p>
<br>
<p>
    As an example if the round where you chose the lottery "4/10 of $2.00 or 6/10 of $3.00" is picked, imagine a bag containing 10 balls.
    4 of the balls in the bag are blue and 6 are red. One of the balls will be picked at random and if a blue ball is picked, you will receive $2.00.
    If a red ball is picked, you'll receive a payoff of $3.00.
