In round 1, you work on a data entry task of the same type and difficulty task as your team.
The task is identical to the task that you performed in your interview. You will also have 90 seconds to complete the task.<br><br>
You will earn <b>$0.15</b> per correct entry during this round while your workers earn <b>$0.10</b> per correct submission.<br><br>

Recall that your task is then to count the number of 1s that appear in a table like the one below: <br><br>

  <div class="container">
        <table class="table table-bordered">
                <tr>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.0 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.1 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.2 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.3 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.4 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.5 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.6 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.7 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.8 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.9 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.10 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.11 }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.12 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.13 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.14 }}</td>
                <td> {{ grid_numbers.15 }}</td>
            </tr>
