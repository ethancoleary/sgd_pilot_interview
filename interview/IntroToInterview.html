<p>
    You are free to decide how you wish to interview for the managerial position.
    As previously mentioned, the interviewer rewards performance or luck.
    Regardless of the method by which the position is obtained, becoming a manager entails the continuation of the experiment
    along with multiple opportunities to increase one's earnings.
    </p>
<br>
<p>
    Concretely, you will perform a cognitive task for 90 seconds (the task will be explained in the next page).
    You have the choice of two methods of evaluation for the managerial position.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Compete:</b> A random {{ if player.blind == 0 }}female {{ endif }}worker in the current team who is not up for the managerial position is selected.
        They performed the cognitive task for 90 seconds also as part of their daily tasks.
      If you outperform the worker in 90 seconds, then you receive the managerial position and a $2.00 signing bonus before moving on to your managerial tasks.
    If you do not outperform the worker, you will leave the experiment.</li>
  <li> <b>Roll the die</b> You will receive $0.10 for every correct answer you submit in your 90 seconds.
      Afterwards, a fair die is rolled. If it lands on a 1 or 2, you will be given the manager position (no signing bonus is paid in this case).
      Any other number shown by the die results in you leaving the experiment with your show-up fee and piece-rate earnings from this round.</li>
</ol>

Before you make the decision you are free to try out the task which is described in the next page.
