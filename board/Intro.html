    Congratulations on passing the bar to be promoted to senior management.
Now you are part of a board of experienced and successful managers who will oversee the decisions of a number of managers and conduct a performance review. <br><br>

You will observe the junior manager and their personal performance, their teams' performance signals, as well as some other details about the managers' career and decision.
Using this information, you will vote as to whether you approve of the managers' decision in their ranking of a <b>Worker A</b>.
Should you disprove, the manager will lose one third of their commission entitlement from their chosen <b>Worker A</b>. <br><br>

Recall the first round 1 of performances involves counting the number of ones in a 4x4 grid.
The manager is choosing the worker they wish to earn commission from in the second round where the workers count the number of ones in a 6x6 grid.
They are able to observe a noisy signal of the workers' performances and the team's total output as well as the workers' pseudonyms when making their decision.<br><br>
