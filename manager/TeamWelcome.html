Congratulations on your appointment as manager here at DataProcess Ltd.
You have been assigned to manage a team of two workers within our Data Entry subdivision. In your role, your work time is divided equally between data entry and managing your team. Your team is always performing data entry and are real humans. <br><br>

In round 1, you work on a data entry task of the same type and difficulty task as your team.
You will earn $0.15 per correct entry during this round while your workers earn $0.10 per correct submission.<br><br>

In round 2 your team will perform the same type of data entry but with increased difficulty.
Before this round begins, you will be able to view how well your workers do in the round 1 (when you are working alongside them).
With this information, you will choose one of your workers to be Worker A.
Who you assign to be Worker A will affect both your payoff and the payoff of the workers. <br><br>

Concretely, the following is determined by your choice of Worker A:
<br>

<ul>
    <li>You, as manager, will earn $0.20 per correct answer Worker A submits in round 2.</li>
    <li>Worker A will receive a non-zero bonus payment as a reward.</li>
</ul>
<br>

Your team is seen below:
