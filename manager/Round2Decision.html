<h3>Prior to beginning round 2, you must choose one of your workers to be ranked as <b>Worker A</b>.</h3>
Both workers have worked on the hard task for 60 seconds following their previous performance.
Your task is to now pick a worker, call them <b>Worker A</b>.<br><br>

Recall, while the workers receive <b>$0.10</b> per correct answer they submit, you will earn a commission of <b>$0.20</b> for every correct answer your chosen <b>Worker A</b> submits.
You do not earn commission from the other worker. <b>Worker A</b> will also receive an entry for a draw to receive a bonus of $1.00.
Multiple managers may work with the same teams and so the draw will be determined according to how many entries each worker receives. <br><br>

{{ if participant.t3_observed == 1 }}
Recall that you are under observation by your senior management board. Each member of the board is an experienced senior manager and will individually vote on their approval of your choice of <b>Worker A</b>.
For every board member that disapproves of your choice, you will be deducted one third of your commission in this stage. <br><br>
{{ endif }}

Now you must choose your <b>Worker A</b>
