{{ block content }}


In this final round, you will perform the same grid task while competing with three other randomly chosen participants.
    Of this group, there will be two winners.
    If you are one of the winners, you will receive a one-off bonus of $1.00 and continue to stage 2 where you will be given an increased level of responsibility and more earning opportunities.
    If you are a loser in this round, you will be paid your participation fee and will exit the experiment.

<br> <br>
The two winners of this round will be the top two performers in the tasks over 20 seconds. Draws will be decided by a fair coin flip. <br><br>

{{ if participant.quota == 1 }}
Additionally, there is a gender quota for this tournament. At least one of the winners must be a female.
Therefore, to guarantee a winning position, you must either be the top performing female or be in one of the top two positions of the group. <br><br>
